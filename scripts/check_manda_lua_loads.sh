# LuaJIT caps a chunk at 200 local variables and the top-level chunk of the
# bundled config is already at capacity, so one new top-level `local` breaks
# startup while the edit itself looks fine. See "Bundled manda.lua Pitfalls"
# in config/AGENTS.md.
#
# Reads the hook JSON payload on stdin. Exits 0 (silent) unless the edited
# file is the bundled manda.lua and it fails to load. Also accepts a file path
# as $1 for manual runs.
